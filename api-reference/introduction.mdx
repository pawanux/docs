# UnleashX API Documentation

Welcome to the UnleashX API! Our comprehensive API enables you to build sophisticated voice AI applications, manage conversational agents, and integrate human-like conversations into your workflows.

## What is UnleashX?

UnleashX is a platform for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered voice agents and workflows. Our APIs provide everything you need to build intelligent voice applications at scale.

## Key Features

- **Voice AI Agents**: Create and manage agents for natural conversations
- **Phone & Chat Integration**: Make/receive calls, build chatbots
- **API Control**: Automate calls, control voice agents via API
- **Workflow Automation**: Design complex workflow automations
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Track usage and performance

## Getting Started

To get started you need to log in to the UnleashX portal:

- Visit the portal at `https://www.tryunleashx.com/login` and sign in with your account.
- After signing in, open **Profile & Settings** → **API Key** and generate a persistent API token (this is the value you will pass in the `token` header).

For full authentication instructions and examples (token usage, generation, and verification), see the Authentication guide: `/api-reference/authentication`.

## Base URL

All API requests should use:

```
https://www.tryunleashx.com/api/v1/global
```


## API Design
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent, resource-oriented URLs
- **JSON Format**: Accepts and returns `application/json`
- **Standard HTTP**: Uses HTTP verbs and status codes
- **Token Auth**: API requests require a valid `token` header (your API token)

## Example: Agent Creation (Authenticated)

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.tryunleashx.com/api/agent/createagentorupdate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "token: 359b83f4...your_api_token_here" \
  -d '{
    "basic_details": {
      "agent_name": "My Agent",
      "description": "A helpful assistant",
      "agent_type": 1
    }
  }'
```

## Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid/expired token)
- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Rate Limited
- `500` - Server Error
