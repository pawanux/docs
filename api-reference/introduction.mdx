## Getting Started

### 1. Authentication

- Navigate to the Developers tab
- Click `Generate a new API Key`
- Save your API Key securely (it is shown only once)

### 2. Using the API Key

Include your API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.tryunleashx.com/v1/agent/all
```

### 3. Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.tryunleashx.com/v1/
```

## API Design

UnleashX APIs feature:

- **RESTful Design**: Consistent, resource-oriented URLs
- **JSON Format**: Accept `application/json` request bodies and return JSON responses
- **Standard HTTP**: Use standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to ensure fair usage
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event notifications for your applications

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example to create your first voice agent:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tryunleashx.com/v1/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Agent",
    "language": "en-US",
    "prompt": "You are a helpful customer service assistant."
  }'
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Rate Limited
- `500` - Server Error

## Pagination

Standard cursor-based pagination is supported on list endpoints:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ==",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

- **Free Plan**: 100 requests per minute
