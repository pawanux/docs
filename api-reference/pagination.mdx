title: Pagination
---

Most list endpoints support cursor-based pagination.

- Use `limit` to control page size
- Use `next_cursor` from the response to fetch the next page

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.tryunleashx.com/v2/call/all?limit=50&cursor=<next_cursor>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_key>'
```
