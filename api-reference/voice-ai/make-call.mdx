## Important Notes

### Phone Number Format
- **Required:** Phone numbers must include country code with `+` prefix
- **Correct:** `+1234567890`, `+919876543210`
- **Incorrect:** `1234567890`, `919876543210` (missing `+`)

The API will automatically add the `+` prefix if it's missing, but it's recommended to include it.

### Agent Requirements
- The agent must be **active** (status = 1) to make calls
- Only voice agents (agent_type = 3) can be used for calls
- The agent must belong to your workspace
- For outbound calls (making calls to customers), the agent should have `calling_type: 1`
- For inbound calls (receiving calls), the agent should have `calling_type: 2`

### Calling Types

| ID | Type | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Outbound** | Agent makes calls to customers. Use this when you want the agent to initiate calls to phone numbers. |
| 2 | **Inbound** | Agent receives calls from customers. Use this when customers call your phone numbers and the agent answers. |

**Note:** When making calls using this API, ensure the agent's `calling_type` is set to `1` (Outbound) for outbound calling scenarios.

### Execution ID
- Store the `execution_id` returned in the response for tracking purposes
- This ID can be used to query call status and details later

### Metadata
- The `metadata` field is optional but useful for passing context
- Common use cases:
  - Customer information
  - Order details
  - Call reason/purpose
  - Custom tracking IDs
- Metadata will be available during the call for the agent to reference

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Phone Numbers**: Ensure phone numbers are in correct format before making the call
2. **Check Agent Status**: Verify the agent is active before initiating calls
3. **Store Execution IDs**: Keep track of execution IDs for call monitoring and analytics
4. **Use Metadata**: Pass relevant context in metadata for better call handling
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for failed call attempts
6. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of rate limits when making multiple calls

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Agent not found or not active"
- **Solution**: Verify the agent exists and has status = 1 (active). Use the Get Agent API to check status.

### Issue: "Phone Number is required"
- **Solution**: Ensure `phone_number` is included in the request body.

### Issue: Invalid phone number format
- **Solution**: Ensure phone number includes country code with `+` prefix (e.g., `+1234567890`).
