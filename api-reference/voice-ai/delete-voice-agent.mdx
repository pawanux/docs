# Delete Voice Voice Agent

Voice voice agent deletion in the system is implemented as a **soft delete** mechanism. When a voice voice agent is deleted, it is not physically removed from the database. Instead, the voice voice agent's status is set to `2` (deleted), and the voice voice agent is marked as inactive. This approach preserves data integrity, maintains audit trails, and allows for potential recovery.

## Deletion Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/voice agent/status`

**Authentication:** Standard authentication (no Super Admin required)

**Controller:** `src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js` - `updateVoice AgentStatus`

**Location:** ```2469:2597:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

## Request Structure

```json
{
  "voice agent_id": 123,
  "status": 2  // 2 = Deleted
}
```

## Deletion Process Flow

### 1. Transaction Initialization

**Location:** ```2470:2470:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

- A database transaction is started to ensure atomicity
- All deletion operations are performed within this transaction
- If any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back

### 2. Validation

**Location:** ```2477:2499:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

1. **Required Fields Validation:**
   - Validates `voice agent_id` is provided
   - Validates `status` is provided

2. **Voice Agent Existence Check:**
   - Checks if voice agent exists in database
   - Verifies voice agent belongs to the user's workspace
   - Throws "Voice Agent not found" error if voice agent doesn't exist

### 3. Status Update

**Location:** ```2525:2536:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

- Updates voice agent `STATUS` field to `2` (deleted)
- Updates `UPDATED_BY` with current user ID
- Updates `UPDATED_ON` with current timestamp
- Stores old voice agent data for change tracking

### 4. External Service Cleanup

When an voice agent is deleted (status = 2), the system performs cleanup operations with external services:

#### 4.1. Millis AI Platform Deletion

**Location:** ```2537:2558:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

**Process:**
1. Parses voice agent metadata to extract `platform_voice agent_id`
2. Extracts `platform_voice agent_id` from:
   ```javascript
   voice agentMetadata?.successful_platform_integrations?.millis_ai?.platform_voice agent_id
   ```
3. If `platform_voice agent_id` exists:
   - Calls Millis AI API DELETE endpoint: `https://api-west.millis.ai/voice agents/{voice agent_id}`
   - Deletes voice agent from Millis AI platform
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors are logged but don't break the deletion process
   - Deletion continues even if external API call fails
   - Error message: "Failed to delete voice agent from Millis AI"

#### 4.2. Knowledge Base Deletion from AI Service

**Location:** ```2559:2561:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

**Function:** `deleteKnowledgeToAI(auth, voice agentId)`

**Location:** ```4397:4417:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

**Process:**
1. Calls AI service endpoint: `${process.env.AI_SOURCE_BASE_URL}/knowledge-base/delete`
2. Sends deletion request with:
   - `company_id`
   - `workspace_id`
   - `voice agent_id`
3. Removes voice agent's knowledge base from AI service
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors are thrown and logged
   - Deletion process continues (errors don't rollback transaction)

### 5. Change Tracking

**Location:** ```2569:2575:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

- Tracks status change in change history
- Records old status and new status (2 = deleted)
- Stores user information, timestamp, IP address, and user voice agent
- **Error Handling:**
  - Change tracking errors are logged but don't break deletion
  - Deletion continues even if tracking fails

### 6. Transaction Commit

**Location:** ```2580:2580:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

- Commits database transaction
- All changes are persisted
- Voice Agent is now marked as deleted in the database

### 7. Response

**Location:** ```2583:2591:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Voice Agent Deleted Successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Voice Agent Name",
    "status": 2
  }
}
```

## Soft Delete Mechanism

### What is Soft Delete?

Soft delete means the voice agent record remains in the database but is marked as deleted. The voice agent is not physically removed from the database.

**Benefits:**
- **Data Preservation:** Historical data is maintained
- **Audit Trail:** Complete record of all voice agents and their history
- **Recovery:** Deleted voice agents can potentially be restored
- **Referential Integrity:** Related records remain intact
- **Analytics:** Historical data can be analyzed

### How Soft Delete Works

1. **Status Field:**
   - Voice Agent `STATUS` field is set to `2` (deleted)
   - All other voice agent data remains unchanged

2. **Query Filtering:**
   - All queries filter out deleted voice agents using: `STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }`
   - Deleted voice agents are excluded from:
     - Voice Agent lists
     - Voice Agent searches
     - Voice Agent selections
     - Public voice agent listings

3. **Related Records:**
   - Related records (knowledge base, tools, configurations) are **NOT** automatically deleted
   - They remain in the database but are associated with a deleted voice agent
   - Some queries may filter these out based on voice agent status

## What Happens to Related Data

### 1. Voice Agent Configuration

**Status:** Remains in database
- `Voice AgentConfiguration` records remain unchanged
- Associated with deleted voice agent via `AGENT_ID`
- Not automatically deleted

### 2. Knowledge Base

**Status:** Remains in database, deleted from AI service
- `Voice AgentKnowledgebase` records remain in database
- Knowledge base files remain in cloud storage
- **Deleted from AI service** (via `deleteKnowledgeToAI` function)
- Files are not removed from cloud storage

### 3. Tools and Sub-voice agents

**Status:** Remain in database
- `Voice AgentAppTools` records remain unchanged
- Tools and sub-voice agents remain associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 4. Calling Numbers

**Status:** Remain in database
- `Voice AgentCallingNumbers` records remain unchanged
- Phone numbers remain associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 5. Denied Words

**Status:** Remain in database
- `Voice AgentDeniedWords` records remain unchanged
- Denied words remain associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 6. Dispositions

**Status:** Remain in database
- `Voice AgentDisposition` records remain unchanged
- Dispositions remain associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 7. Guardrails

**Status:** Remain in database
- Guardrail settings remain unchanged
- Associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 8. Metadata

**Status:** Remain in database
- Metadata configurations remain unchanged
- Associated with deleted voice agent
- Not automatically deleted

### 9. Change History

**Status:** Preserved
- All change history records remain
- Complete audit trail is maintained
- Includes deletion event in history

## External Service Cleanup

### 1. Millis AI Platform

**Action:** Voice Agent is deleted from Millis AI platform

**Endpoint:** `DELETE https://api-west.millis.ai/voice agents/{platform_voice agent_id}`

**Process:**
1. Extracts `platform_voice agent_id` from voice agent metadata
2. Calls DELETE endpoint
3. Removes voice agent from Millis AI platform

**Error Handling:**
- Errors are logged but don't break deletion
- Deletion continues even if external API fails

### 2. AI Service Knowledge Base

**Action:** Knowledge base is deleted from AI service

**Endpoint:** `POST ${AI_SOURCE_BASE_URL}/knowledge-base/delete`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "company_id": "123",
  "workspace_id": "456",
  "voice agent_id": "789"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Calls AI service deletion endpoint
2. Removes all knowledge base data for the voice agent
3. Voice Agent can no longer access knowledge base in AI service

**Error Handling:**
- Errors are thrown and logged
- Deletion process continues

## Query Filtering

### How Deleted Voice Agents are Filtered

All queries that retrieve voice agents filter out deleted voice agents:

**Pattern Used:**

```javascript
STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }  // Not equal to 2 (deleted)
```

**Examples:**

1. **Voice Agent List:**

   ```javascript
   where: {
     WORKSPACE_ID: auth.workspace_id,
     STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }  // Excludes deleted voice agents
   }
   ```

2. **Voice Agent Search:**

   ```javascript
   where: {
     AGENT_NAME: { [Op.like]: '%search%' },
     STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }  // Excludes deleted voice agents
   }
   ```

3. **Public Voice Agents:**

   ```javascript
   where: {
     AGENT_PRIVACY: 1,
     STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }  // Excludes deleted voice agents
   }
   ```

4. **Voice Agent Details:**

   ```javascript
   where: {
     ID: voice agent_id,
     STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }  // Excludes deleted voice agents
   }
   ```

## Status Values

### Voice Agent Status Values

- **1 (Published):** Voice Agent is active and available for use
- **2 (Deleted):** Voice Agent is soft-deleted (marked as deleted, not removed from database)
- **3 (Unpublished):** Voice Agent is inactive but not deleted

### Status Transitions

**To Delete:**
- Any status → Status 2 (Deleted)

**From Delete:**
- Status 2 → Status 1 (Published) - Can be restored
- Status 2 → Status 3 (Unpublished) - Can be restored

**Note:** The system allows restoring deleted voice agents by updating their status back to 1 or 3.

## Error Handling

### 1. Transaction Rollback

**Location:** ```2593:2596:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js```

- If any critical error occurs, the entire transaction is rolled back
- Voice Agent status is not updated
- All database changes are reverted
- Ensures data consistency

### 2. Validation Errors

- **Missing voice agent_id:** Throws validation error
- **Missing status:** Throws validation error
- **Voice Agent not found:** Throws "Voice Agent not found" error
- **Voice Agent belongs to different workspace:** Throws "Voice Agent not found" error

### 3. External Service Errors

**Millis AI API Errors:**
- Errors are logged: "Failed to delete voice agent from Millis AI"
- Deletion continues even if external API fails
- Voice Agent is still marked as deleted in database

**AI Service Errors:**
- Errors are thrown and logged
- Deletion process continues
- Knowledge base may remain in AI service if deletion fails

### 4. Change Tracking Errors

- Errors are logged: "Error tracking voice agent status change"
- Deletion continues even if tracking fails
- Voice Agent is still marked as deleted

## Recovery and Restoration

### Can Deleted Voice Agents be Restored?

**Yes**, deleted voice agents can be restored by updating their status:

**Restore to Published:**

```json
POST /api/voice agent/status
{
  "voice agent_id": 123,
  "status": 1  // Restore to published
}
```

**Restore to Unpublished:**

```json
POST /api/voice agent/status
{
  "voice agent_id": 123,
  "status": 3  // Restore to unpublished
}
```

### What Happens on Restoration?

1. **Database:**
   - Voice Agent status is updated to 1 or 3
   - Voice Agent becomes visible in queries again

2. **External Services:**
   - Millis AI: Voice Agent is NOT automatically recreated
   - AI Service: Knowledge base is NOT automatically restored
   - Manual intervention may be required for external services

3. **Related Data:**
   - All related data (knowledge base, tools, etc.) becomes accessible again
   - No data is lost during deletion/restoration

## Code References

### Main Deletion Handler

```2469:2597:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js
module.exports.updateVoice AgentStatus = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Voice Agent status update handler
  // Handles deletion when status = 2
}
```

### Status Update

```2525:2536:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js
await db.Voice AgentDetails.update(
  {
    STATUS: postData.status == 2 ? 2 : postData.status,
    // ...
  }
);
```

### Millis AI Deletion

```2537:2558:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js
if (postData.status == 2) {
  // Call Millis AI API to delete voice agent
  // Extract platform_voice agent_id from metadata
  // DELETE https://api-west.millis.ai/voice agents/{voice agent_id}
}
```

### Knowledge Base Deletion

```2559:2561:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js
if (postData.status == 2) {
  deleteKnowledgeToAI(auth, voice agent.ID);
}
```

### Delete Knowledge Base Function

```4397:4417:src/controllers/voice agentbuild/voice agentController.js
const deleteKnowledgeToAI = async (auth, voice agentId) => {
  // Deletes knowledge base from AI service
  // POST ${AI_SOURCE_BASE_URL}/knowledge-base/delete
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Deletion Checks

Before deleting an voice agent, consider:
- **Active Usage:** Check if voice agent is currently in use
- **Dependencies:** Verify no critical workflows depend on the voice agent
- **Backup:** Ensure important data is backed up if needed

### 2. Post-Deletion Actions

After deletion:
- **Verify External Cleanup:** Check if external services were cleaned up
- **Monitor Logs:** Review logs for any deletion errors
- **Update Documentation:** Document any manual cleanup required

### 3. Restoration Planning

If restoration might be needed:
- **Document Dependencies:** Note external service dependencies
- **Plan Restoration:** Prepare restoration procedures
- **Test Restoration:** Test restoration process if possible

### 4. Error Handling

- **Monitor External APIs:** Monitor Millis AI and AI service responses
- **Handle Failures:** Have procedures for handling external API failures
- **Log Analysis:** Regularly review deletion logs

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authorization

- Standard authentication required (not Super Admin)
- Users can only delete voice agents in their workspace
- Cross-workspace deletion is prevented

### 2. Audit Trail

- All deletions are tracked in change history
- User information is recorded
- Timestamp and IP address are logged

### 3. Data Protection

- Soft delete preserves data for compliance
- Historical records are maintained
- Recovery is possible if needed

## Limitations

### 1. External Service Cleanup

- **Millis AI:** Errors in external API don't prevent deletion
- **AI Service:** Knowledge base deletion may fail silently
- **Manual Cleanup:** May require manual intervention for external services

### 2. Related Data

- Related records are not automatically deleted
- Some orphaned records may remain
- Manual cleanup may be required for complete removal

### 3. Storage

- Deleted voice agents still consume database storage
- Knowledge base files remain in cloud storage
- No automatic cleanup of storage

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Agent Still Visible After Deletion

**Possible Causes:**
1. Transaction not committed
2. Query not filtering by status
3. Cache not cleared

**Solutions:**
1. Verify transaction was committed
2. Check query includes `STATUS: { [Op.ne]: 2 }`
3. Clear application cache

### External Service Not Cleaned Up

**Possible Causes:**
1. External API call failed
2. Network issues
3. Invalid platform_voice agent_id

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs for API errors
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Manually delete from external service if needed

### Knowledge Base Not Deleted from AI Service

**Possible Causes:**
1. AI service API call failed
2. Invalid voice agent_id
3. Service unavailable

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs for API errors
2. Verify voice agent_id is correct
3. Retry deletion or manual cleanup

## Notes

- Deletion is a soft delete - voice agent remains in database
- All related data is preserved
- External services are cleaned up (with error handling)
- Deleted voice agents can be restored
- Complete audit trail is maintained
- Queries automatically filter out deleted voice agents
- No physical data removal occurs
