# Create Form

Create a new form in your workspace. Forms are customizable data collection structures that can be used to gather and store information from users.

## Overview

The Create Form API endpoint allows you to create a new form object in your workspace. When you create a form, the system automatically handles:

- Form registration and organization
- Unique identifier generation
- File uploads for branding (banner and logo)
- Data storage structure setup
- Workspace and company association

## File Uploads

### Supported File Types

- **Banner and Logo:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, GIF

### File Upload Guidelines

1. **File Size:** Ensure files are reasonably sized for web use
2. **File Format:** Only image formats listed above are accepted
3. **Validation:** The system validates both file extension and MIME type
4. **Storage:** Files are securely stored and associated with your workspace

### Upload Behavior

- Files are uploaded to workspace-specific directories
- Banner images are stored in: `{workspace_id}/forms/banner`
- Logo images are stored in: `{workspace_id}/forms/logo`
- You can provide either a file upload or an existing file path

## Automatic Features

### Name Uniqueness

If a form with the same name already exists in your workspace, the system automatically appends a number suffix to ensure uniqueness:

- "Contact Form" → "Contact Form (1)" (if "Contact Form" exists)
- "Contact Form" → "Contact Form (2)" (if both exist)

### Slug Generation

A unique slug is automatically generated from the form name:

- Special characters are removed
- Text is converted to lowercase
- A random 6-digit number is appended for uniqueness
- Example: "Contact Form" → "contactform123456"

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS` | A form with the same slug already exists | This is rare and typically handled automatically by name uniqueness |
| `COMPANY_NOT_FOUND` | Company details not found | Verify your authentication token and workspace access |
| `INVALID_FORM_BANNER_FILE_TYPE` | Banner file type is not supported | Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF format |
| `INVALID_FORM_LOGO_FILE_TYPE` | Logo file type is not supported | Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF format |
| `FORM_BANNER_FILE_REQUIRED` | Banner file field is present but empty | Either provide a valid file or omit the field |
| `FORM_LOGO_FILE_REQUIRED` | Logo file field is present but empty | Either provide a valid file or omit the field |

## Data Storage

When you create a form, the system automatically sets up data storage structures:

- **Primary Table:** Stores metadata for each form submission (one record per submission)
- **Secondary Table:** Stores the actual form field data in a flexible key-value structure

These tables are created automatically when needed and are shared across all forms in your company for efficient data management.

## Best Practices

1. **Form Naming:** Use descriptive, clear names for your forms to make them easy to identify
2. **File Uploads:** Optimize images before uploading to ensure fast loading times
3. **Descriptions:** Provide clear descriptions to help team members understand each form's purpose
4. **Organization:** Use folders to organize related forms together
5. **Error Handling:** Always check the response status and handle errors appropriately in your application

## Related Operations

After creating a form, you can:

- **Add Form Sections:** Use the form sections API to define the structure and fields
- **Update Form:** Modify form details, banner, logo, or description
- **List Forms:** Retrieve all forms in your workspace
- **Submit Form Data:** Once configured, users can submit data to your form
- **Clone Form:** Duplicate an existing form to create a new one with similar structure

## Notes

- Form slugs are unique per workspace, not globally across all workspaces
- File uploads are optional - you can create forms without banners or logos
- Forms can be organized in folders using the `folder_id` parameter
- The system automatically handles data storage structure setup
- All operations are transactional - if any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back
