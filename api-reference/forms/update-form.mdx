## Update Behavior

### Partial Updates

- Only fields you provide will be updated
- Fields not included in the request remain unchanged
- You can update specific fields without affecting others

**Example:**
```json
// Update only form name
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "object_name": "New Name"
}
// All other fields remain unchanged
```

### File Upload Behavior

1. **New File Upload:** If you upload a new file, it replaces the existing file
2. **File Path Provided:** If you provide a file path, the system uses that path (assumes file already exists)
3. **Neither Provided:** If you don't provide a file or path, the existing file is retained

### Automatic Updates

The following fields are automatically updated by the system:
- `UPDATED_ON` - Set to current timestamp
- `UPDATED_BY` - Set to the authenticated user ID
- `IP_ADDRESS` - Recorded from the request
- `USER_AGENT` - Recorded from the request headers

## File Upload Guidelines

### Supported File Types

- **Banner, Logo, Screenshot:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, GIF

### File Upload Requirements

1. **File Size:** Ensure files are reasonably sized for web use
2. **File Format:** Only image formats listed above are accepted
3. **Validation:** The system validates both file extension and MIME type
4. **Storage:** Files are securely stored in company-specific directories:
   - Banner images: `{company_id}/forms/banner`
   - Logo images: `{company_id}/forms/logo`
   - Screenshot images: `{company_id}/forms/screenshot`

## Important Notes

- `object_id` is **required** - all other fields are optional
- Partial updates are supported - only include fields you want to change
- File uploads replace existing files when new files are provided
- Updates are transactional - if any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back
- Cache is automatically cleared after successful updates
- Updates are immediately reflected in the system
- The system automatically tracks who made the update and when
