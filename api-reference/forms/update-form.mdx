# Update Form

Update an existing form's metadata, appearance, or configuration. You can modify the form name, description, banner, logo, rating, and other settings.

## Overview

The Update Form API allows you to modify form properties after creation. There are two types of updates available:

1. **Form Metadata Update** - Update the form's configuration, appearance, and settings
2. **Form Data Update** - Update individual form submission records (covered separately)

This endpoint handles form metadata updates, including name, description, branding images, and ratings.

## Endpoint

**PUT** `/form` or **POST** `/update-object`

**Base URL:** `https://api.tryunleashx.com/v1`

**Authentication:** Required (Bearer token)

## Request Parameters

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `object_id` | integer | The unique identifier of the form to update. |

### Optional Parameters

All other parameters are optional. If not provided, existing values are retained.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `object_name` | string | New name for the form. |
| `form_description` | string | Updated description of the form. |

## Request Example

### Using cURL (with file uploads)

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.tryunleashx.com/v1/form \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "object_id=123" \
  -F "object_name=Updated Contact Form" \
  -F "form_description=Updated description" \
  -F "form_banner=@/path/to/new-banner.png" \
  -F "rating=4.5"
```

### Using JSON (without file uploads)

```json
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "object_name": "Updated Contact Form",
  "form_description": "Updated description for the contact form",
  "rating": 4.5
}
```

## Response

### Success Response

**Status Code:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "message": "OBJECT_UPDATED_SUCCESSFULLY"
}
```

## File Uploads

### Supported File Types

- **Banner, Logo, Screenshot:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, GIF

### File Update Behavior

1. **New File Upload:** If you upload a new file, it replaces the existing file
2. **File Path Provided:** If you provide a file path, the system uses that path (assumes file already exists)
3. **Neither Provided:** If you don't provide a file or path, the existing file is retained

### File Storage

Files are stored in company-specific directories:
- Banner: `{company_id}/forms/banner`
- Logo: `{company_id}/forms/logo`
- Screenshot: `{company_id}/forms/screenshot`

## Update Behavior

### Partial Updates

The update operation supports partial updates:

- **Fields Provided:** Only the fields you provide will be updated
- **Fields Omitted:** Fields not included in the request retain their existing values
- **Null Values:** To clear a field, you may need to explicitly set it to `null` (check API documentation for specific field behavior)

### Automatic Updates

The following fields are automatically updated by the system:

- `UPDATED_ON` - Set to current timestamp
- `UPDATED_BY` - Set to the authenticated user ID
- `IP_ADDRESS` - Recorded from the request
- `USER_AGENT` - Recorded from the request headers

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` | The form with the specified ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to your workspace | Verify the form ID and ensure you have access to it |
| `INVALID_FORM_BANNER_FILE_TYPE` | Banner file type is not supported | Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF format |
| `INVALID_FORM_LOGO_FILE_TYPE` | Logo file type is not supported | Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF format |
| `INVALID_SCREENSHOT_FILE_TYPE` | Screenshot file type is not supported | Use PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF format |
| `FORM_BANNER_FILE_REQUIRED` | Banner file field is present but empty | Either provide a valid file or omit the field |
| `FORM_LOGO_FILE_REQUIRED` | Logo file field is present but empty | Either provide a valid file or omit the field |
| `SCREENSHOT_FILE_REQUIRED` | Screenshot file field is present but empty | Either provide a valid file or omit the field |

## Best Practices

1. **Selective Updates:** Only include fields you want to change to avoid unnecessary updates
2. **File Optimization:** Optimize images before uploading to ensure fast loading
3. **Validation:** Validate file types and sizes on your client side before sending requests
4. **Error Handling:** Always check response status and handle errors appropriately
5. **Idempotency:** The update operation is safe to retry if a request fails

## Update Form Data vs Update Form Metadata

It's important to understand the difference between updating form metadata and updating form submission data:

| Aspect | Form Metadata Update | Form Data Update |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **What it updates** | Form configuration and settings | Individual form submission records |
| **Target** | Form object itself | Form submission data |
| **Use case** | Change form name, description, branding | Modify submitted form field values |
| **Endpoint** | `PUT /form` or `POST /update-object` | `POST /update-form-object` |

## Example Use Cases

### Update Form Name and Description

```json
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "object_name": "Customer Feedback Form 2024",
  "form_description": "Updated feedback form for 2024 with new questions"
}
```

### Update Branding Images

```json
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "form_banner": "path/to/new-banner.png",
  "form_logo": "path/to/new-logo.png"
}
```

### Update Rating

```json
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "rating": 4.8
}
```

### Update Multiple Fields

```json
{
  "object_id": 123,
  "object_name": "Enhanced Contact Form",
  "form_description": "Improved contact form with better UX",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "form_banner": "path/to/banner.png"
}
```

## Notes

- All updates are transactional - if any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back
- File uploads replace existing files when new files are provided
- The system automatically tracks who made the update and when
- Updates are immediately reflected in the system
- Cache is automatically cleared after successful updates
