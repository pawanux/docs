title: Concurrency tiers
---

UnleashX provides concurrency tiers to support parallel call capacity.

## What is concurrency?

The number of calls your agents can handle simultaneously.

## Tiers (illustrative)

- Dev: up to 5 concurrent calls — ideal for testing
- Standard: up to 50 concurrent calls — pilots and small teams
- Scale: up to 200 concurrent calls — production workloads
- Enterprise: 200+ concurrent calls — custom SLAs and burst capacity

## Best practices

- Start low, observe metrics, then scale gradually
- Use queueing and backoff for bursty workloads
- Monitor average and p95 call durations to size tiers
