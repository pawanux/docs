title: Call Pricing
---

Understand how UnleashX pricing works across usage levels and features.

## Pricing models

- Per‑minute billing: pay only for actual call time
- Monthly subscriptions: fixed fee with bundled minutes
- Per‑agent pricing: scale with number of agents

## Typical tiers (illustrative)

- Starter: 100–200 minutes included, basic features
- Growth: 500–2,000 minutes, advanced conversation features
- Enterprise: high minutes, custom voices, analytics, SSO, SLAs

## Example header usage

```
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

## Considerations

- Overage charges when minutes exceed plan allotments
- Add‑ons (calendar, CRM, analytics) may carry additional fees
- Regional rates and telephony provider fees may apply
