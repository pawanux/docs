UnleashX is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that enables you to build sophisticated voice agents, chatbots, and automated workflows. Our platform combines advanced AI technology with easy-to-use tools to help you create, deploy, and manage conversational AI at scale.

## What types of workflows can I create with UnleashX?

UnleashX.ai provides five distinct workflow trigger types that enable you to create comprehensive automation for virtually any business process:

### Event Based Actions in App
Event-based workflows automatically execute when specific events occur within your connected applications. These workflows respond instantly to real-time changes in your business systems, ensuring immediate action when important events happen.

### Scheduled Actions
Scheduled workflows execute at predetermined times and frequencies, perfect for recurring business tasks that need to happen on a regular basis. You can set up time-based scheduling with flexible frequency options - daily, multiple times per day, weekly, or custom schedules.

### One-Time Actions
One-time workflows execute immediately when you trigger them manually, perfect for ad-hoc tasks or processes you want to run on-demand. These workflows are ideal for data migrations, one-off reports, bulk updates, or any process you need to execute immediately.

Form submission workflows trigger automatically when someone submits a form connected to your workflow system. These workflows are particularly powerful for lead generation, customer onboarding, support requests, and any process that begins with data collection from users or customers.
