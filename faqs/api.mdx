# API FAQs

## How do I get started with the API?

1. **Get Your API Key**: Sign up and generate your API key from the dashboard
2. **Read the Documentation**: Check our comprehensive API reference
3. **Try the Interactive Playground**: Test API calls directly in the documentation
4. **Start Building**: Use our SDKs or make direct HTTP requests

## What authentication method do you use?

We use Bearer Token authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://www.tryunleashx.com/v1/agent/all
```

## What's the API rate limit?

Our API rate limits are:
- **Free Plan**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits based on your needs

Rate limits are applied per API key and reset every minute.

## What data formats do you support?

We support:
- **Request/Response**: JSON
- **File Uploads**: Multipart form data
- **Webhooks**: JSON payloads
- **Data Export**: JSON, CSV

## How do I handle webhooks?

1. **Set up your endpoint**: Create a webhook URL that can receive POST requests
2. **Configure in dashboard**: Add your webhook URL in the dashboard settings
3. **Verify signatures**: Use our signature verification to ensure authenticity
4. **Handle events**: Process incoming webhook events in your application

## What webhook events are available?

We support webhooks for:
- Call started/completed
- Agent responses
- Error events
- User interactions
- System notifications

## Can I test API calls without making real calls?

Yes! We provide:
- **Sandbox Environment**: Test API calls without charges
- **Mock Responses**: Simulated responses for development
- **Interactive Playground**: Try API calls directly in documentation
- **SDK Examples**: Code samples in multiple languages

## How do I handle errors?

Our API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- **200**: Success
- **201**: Created
- **400**: Bad Request
- **401**: Unauthorized
- **404**: Not Found
- **429**: Rate Limited
- **500**: Server Error

Error responses include detailed error messages and error codes.

## What SDKs do you provide?

We offer official SDKs for:
- **Python**: `pip install unleashx`
- **Node.js**: `npm install unleashx`
- **PHP**: `composer require unleashx/unleashx`
- **Ruby**: `gem install unleashx`

## How do I track API usage?

You can monitor your API usage through:
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time usage statistics
- **API Response Headers**: Rate limit information in responses
- **Webhook Events**: Usage notifications
- **Monthly Reports**: Detailed usage breakdowns

## Can I use the API for bulk operations?

Yes! We support:
- **Batch API calls**: Process multiple requests efficiently
- **Bulk data import**: Import large datasets
- **Concurrent requests**: Handle multiple operations simultaneously
- **Async processing**: Long-running operations with status tracking

## How do I get help with API integration?

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Interactive Playground**: Test API calls in your browser
- **Support Email**: cs@unleashx.ai
- **Community Forum**: Connect with other developers
- **GitHub Examples**: Open source integration examples

## Workflow API Integration

### Custom API Configuration
The Custom API integration allows you to configure API endpoints, authentication methods, and data mapping for any external system. You can specify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), define request headers, set authentication parameters including API keys and OAuth tokens, and map workflow data to API parameters.

### Authentication Handling
Authentication handling supports multiple methods including API key authentication, OAuth 2.0 token flows, and basic authentication with username/password combinations. The workflow system manages authentication automatically, including token refresh for OAuth integrations.

### Data Exchange and Transformation
Workflows can send data to external APIs and process the responses for use in subsequent automation steps. Response data becomes available as variables throughout the workflow, enabling sophisticated data-driven automation.

### Error Handling
Error handling capabilities ensure workflows respond appropriately when API calls fail or return unexpected results. You can configure retry attempts, fallback actions, and error notifications to maintain workflow reliability.

### Real-time Integration with Webhooks
The Webhook integration enables real-time bidirectional communication between UnleashX and external systems. Your workflows can send webhooks to notify other systems when important events occur, while also receiving webhook data to trigger UnleashX automations.

## Workflow Data Sources

### Cloud-Based Business Applications
- **Google Workspace**: Sheets, Forms, Drive, Docs, Calendar, Gmail, Analytics
- **Microsoft Office**: Outlook email and calendar data
- **Customer Relationship Management**: HubSpot with comprehensive data access
- **Communication Platforms**: Slack, Discord, WhatsApp
- **Database Systems**: Airtable, Notion
- **Specialized Services**: LinkedIn, HeyGen, Web Search

### Custom Data Sources via API
The Custom API integration enables connection to any data source that provides programmatic access, including proprietary databases, industry-specific applications, and unique business systems.

## Workflow Notification Capabilities

### Email Notifications
Gmail and Outlook integrations enable workflows to send personalized email notifications based on workflow triggers and conditions.

### Team Communication Alerts
Slack integration provides real-time notifications through direct messages, channel posts, and custom formatted alerts.

### Escalation and Priority Notifications
Workflows can implement sophisticated escalation procedures where initial notifications go to primary contacts, then automatically escalate to managers if responses aren't received within specified timeframes.

## Workflow Error Handling

### Conditional Error Detection
The If/Else node system enables workflows to detect and respond to various error conditions using string, number, boolean, and array conditions.

### Integration Failure Management
When external API calls fail or return error responses, workflows can detect these conditions through response code evaluation and content analysis.

### Recovery and Retry Mechanisms
Conditional logic enables workflows to implement sophisticated retry mechanisms when temporary failures occur, including circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures.
